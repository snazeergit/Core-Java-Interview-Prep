/*
int:
The int data type has a maximum value of  2,147,483,647  (as noted earlier).
Factorials grow very quickly, so for numbers greater than 12, the result may exceed this limit,
leading to incorrect calculations (integer overflow).

long:
The factorial of 20 (20!) is the largest factorial that can be accurately stored in a long data type.
Beyond  20! , you must use a larger data type like BigInteger to avoid overflow.

BigInteger:
The maximum factorial that Javaâ€™s BigInteger can compute properly is theoretically
only limited by the amount of memory available, as BigInteger can handle arbitrarily large integers.
